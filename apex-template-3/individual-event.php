                    <p class="">The session provided insights into DevSecOps and Platform Engineering, emphasizing their significance in software development and their role in shaping the future of technology. Some of the highlights of the talk are presented below:</p>
                    <p>The talk began by discussing DevSecOps and its evolution from DevOps. It then further outlined its core components: continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, infrastructure as code, compliance as code, monitoring and logging, and automation, focusing on security at every stage of the development process.</p>
                    <p>The session also discussed how, despite its advantages, organizations face challenges like cultural shifts, toolchain integration, legacy systems, and a skill gap when implementing DevSecOps.</p>
                    <p>Further, it explained the concept of Platform Engineering and its core components, such as self-service infrastructure, infrastructure abstractions, tooling and automation, and Developer Experience (DevEx), and distinguished between traditional IT and Platform Engineering. The talk also highlighted the synergy between DevSecOps and Platform Engineering and how combining these practices creates a robust framework for building secure and scalable applications.</p>
                    <p>The presentation also covered two success stories from Batoi, illustrating the practical applications of these concepts. The talk concluded with a discussion of the future trends in DevSecOps and Platform Engineering.</p>
